Golden Age Hospital Management System - README

1. Purpose of the Program
This Python based command line program simulates a simple hospital management system. 
It allows users to:
- Register patients and doctors
- Book and cancel appointments
- View scheduled appointments
- Generate billing receipts for consultations
It is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and exception handling.

2. How to Run the Program
To run the program you need to ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your computer, then open the terminal or command prompt,navigate to the folder where the '.py' file is saved and finially run the file using: 'python filename.py'

3. Required Modifications
Save patient and doctor data to a file or database so it doesn't disappear after closing the program
Add login features for patients and doctors
Include more billing options like insurance or service types
Create a graphical interface (GUI) for easier use

4. Assumptions & Limitations
Doctor availability must be entered manually (as a list of time slots).
The system allows only one appointment per doctor at any specific time.
Appointment details and other data are not saved once the program closes.
The program is text-based and doesn't include a graphical user interface.
Some basic input validation and error messages are in place, but thereâ€™s room for stronger error checking.
